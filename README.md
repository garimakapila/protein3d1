# Protein3D

I wrote this structural web viewer that renders & highlights human protein features for my independent project when I worked with [Yu Lab](http://yulab.org/) in Fall 2018.
This repository contains only the frontend of Protein3D, and the backend is disconnected. The website will be released at protein3d.yulab.org in the future.

Sample pages temporarily here: [Protein3D](garimakapila.github.io/protein3d)
